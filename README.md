# JWT-Enhanced API Protection

Illustrating the meticulous implementation of OAuth security measures within the configuration of an API endpoint, thereby exemplifying a comprehensive and robust framework designed to safeguard sensitive information and ensure secure access to the designated resources.

### Starting the FastAPI Server

To start the FastAPI server, execute the following command:

```bash
python -m uvicorn Authenticator:app --reload
```

- `python -m uvicorn`: Runs the Uvicorn ASGI server.
- `Authenticator:app`: Specifies the module (`Authenticator`) and the FastAPI application instance (`app`) to serve.
- `--reload`: Enables auto-reloading for development purposes, so changes are applied without restarting the server manually.

### Retrieving API Responses

To interact with the API and retrieve responses, execute:

```bash
python Finance_API.py
```

`Finance_API.py` script, which typically contains the logic for making requests to the API and processing the responses.

## POST
  ##### Token Generation

```bash
http://localhost:port/token
```

##### Body
  ##### x-www-form-urlencoded
    username    anamol
    password    mysecretpassword

Illustrates the systematic utilization of the POST method to generate a JWT (JSON Web Token), elucidating its pivotal role in facilitating secure authentication processes when interfacing with an API endpoint.
